### Activate virtuanenv:
source ~/Databases/Development/TensorFlow/tensorflow/bin/activate

## Backdropping
Dropping neurons, in order to prevent a neural network to be overtrained.
Example: Old people have hard developed neural paths, which prevent them from grasping new ideas

### Transfer learning
Using only the last few layers of an already trained neural network, by changing them,
in order to detect new features
